These Github-based programming assignments (linked below) used the tiny-graphics.js framework.  They are custom assignments made for UCLA's computer graphics course.  The ones that use tiny-graphics.js are on GitHub at the links below:

[Assignment #1: JavaScript Workflow Tutorial](https://github.com/intro-graphics-master/a1_s19)  
Assignment #2: WebGL calls (did not use tiny-graphics.js)  
[Assignment #3: Place some shapes (matrix transformations and their order)](https://github.com/intro-graphics-master/a3_s19)  
[Assignment #4: Modify shaders for a scene](https://github.com/intro-graphics-master/a4_s19)  
(Scroll down to the readme portion  This is where students read a guided tour on common graphics operations.)

Around 1000 students based their course projects on tiny-graphics.js, a sampling of which students opted to host here:

Students were enabled by tiny-graphics.js to efficiently learn the mathematical underpinnings of graphics.
