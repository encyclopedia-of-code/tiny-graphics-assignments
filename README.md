# tiny-graphics-assignments

Around 1000 students have based their course projects on tiny-graphics.js, a beautiful sampling of which some students opted to host here:

The tiny-graphics.js framework is what powered the custom Github-based programming assignments linked below.  These new assignments were used for UCLA's computer graphics course in Spring 2019.  Students were enabled by tiny-graphics.js to efficiently learn the mathematical underpinnings of graphics with these and more in-class code examples.

[Assignment #1: Learning JavaScript and a Good Workflow](https://github.com/intro-graphics-master/a1_s19)  
(Scroll down to the readme portion)

Assignment #2: WebGL calls (did not use tiny-graphics.js)  

[Assignment #3: Place some shapes (matrix transformations and their order)](https://github.com/intro-graphics-master/a3_s19)   

Deliverable:

The development of tiny-graphics.js was one of the main subjects of a published article at the Web3D 2019 conference.
