# tiny-graphics-assignments

The Github-based programming assignments linked below are based on the tiny-graphics.js library.  

[https://github.com/intro-graphics-master/a1_s19](Assignment #1: Environment Setup)
Assignment #2: Use WebGL calls in a simple program to draw shapes (this one did not use tiny-graphics.js)
[https://github.com/intro-graphics-master/a3_s19](Assignment #3: Place some shapes (matrix transformations and their order))
[https://github.com/intro-graphics-master/a4_s19](Assignment #4: Modify shaders for a scene)
(Scroll down to the readme portionÂ  This is where students read a guided tour on common graphics operations.)

Around 1000 students based their course projects on tiny-graphics.js, a sampling of which students opted to host here:

Students were enabled by tiny-graphics.js to efficiently learn the mathematical underpinnings of graphics.

My library lives on GitHub [https://github.com/encyclopedia-of-code/tiny-graphics-js](too), though I haven't kept it up to date as I've learned more coding practices.
