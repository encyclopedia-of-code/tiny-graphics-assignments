Around 1000 students based their course projects on tiny-graphics.js, a sampling of which students opted to host here:

Students were enabled by tiny-graphics.js to efficiently learn the mathematical underpinnings of graphics.

Github-based programming assignments linked below used the tiny-graphics.js framework.  They are custom assignments made for UCLA's computer graphics course.
