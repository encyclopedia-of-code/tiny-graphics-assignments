(Scroll down to the readme portionÂ  This is where students read a guided tour on common graphics operations.)

Around 1000 students based their course projects on tiny-graphics.js, a sampling of which students opted to host here:

Students were enabled by tiny-graphics.js to efficiently learn the mathematical underpinnings of graphics.

My library lives on GitHub [https://github.com/encyclopedia-of-code/tiny-graphics-js](too), though I haven't kept it up to date as I've learned more coding practices.
