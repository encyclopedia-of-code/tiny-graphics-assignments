For the git repo of the tiny-graphics.js library itself, visit this address:

Around 1000 students based their course projects on tiny-graphics.js, a sampling of which students opted to host here:

Students were enabled by tiny-graphics.js to efficiently learn the mathematical underpinnings of graphics.

The tiny-graphics.js framework is what powered the custom Github-based programming assignments linked below.  These new assignments were used for UCLA's computer graphics course in Spring 2019.
